# Study Exit

If the participant completes the study, is ineligible or withdraws for some reason, Study Exit rules are applied to the records around their visibility moving forward. This occurs under the following circumstances:

* The participant indicates during the the phone screener that they are not interested in continuing
* A withdrawal record is added to the IPA Tracker panel, with any of the following reasons:

* subject communicated that he wants to withdraw
* the team determines the subject is lost to follow up
* the subject is no longer participating for some other reason

* The investigator terminated the participant from the study for:

* safety reasons
* non-adherence
* another reason that would deter the participant from completing the study

* The participant is ineligible for the study, based on the inclusion / exclusion phone screener checklist / review process
* The participant indicates during the screening following up that, despite being eligible, he no longer wishes to participate
* A final exit survey record is added to the IPA Tracker, indicating that the assessments are all completed

14 days after Study Exit, the majority of records will no longer be visible to users of the app. The records that remain visible (if they exist) are:

* Transferred Zeus data in the Participant Details panel

* Player Info
* Player Contacts
* Addresses

* Phone Screen finalization record
* Phone Screen Follow-Up record showing eligibility
* Withdrawal record
* Follow-Up Survey record

These records are left visible, since they donâ€™t show any research data or PHI, while ensuring that study staff are able to accurately understand why a participant is no longer fully visible in the app.

Soon after Study Exit, the completion event is transferred back to Zeus and recorded in the tracker automatically as an opt-out or completion event.

The report [IPA In Process & Exited](searches_work_queues_and_reports.md) can help users see the status of participants that exited the study, and why.
