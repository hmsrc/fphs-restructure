# User Roles

Each user is assigned a set of user roles that define:

*   Participants they can view
*   Searches and queues they can access
*   Reports they can run
*   Process tabs they can view
*   Activities they can log
*   Data they can read, edit or create
*   Notifications they receive

A single role typically combines the most appropriate combination of these access controls.
