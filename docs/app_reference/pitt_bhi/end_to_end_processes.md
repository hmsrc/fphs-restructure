# End-to-End Process

The PITT BHI App covers the following stages:

* Subjects identified as potential candidates for recruitment are transferred from the internal FPHS Secure Data Repository to the PITT BHI App server (named Athena)
* FPHS Staff Members communicate with subjects to schedule and perform introductory calls and screening
* Suitable candidates consent to have their information passed to the University of Pittsburgh
* PITT Staff Members receive notifications of new candidates and gain access to their information and screening data
* App users record participant enrollment, ineligibility, withdrawal, completion, and other communications and shared information
* Discussions between app users related to a subject can be securely performed throughout the process

## Identifying Subjects and Enrolled Participants

Every subject transferred to the app has a unique random identifier assigned, allowing them to be referred to without revealing PII. This FPHS PITT BHI ID is a 6-digit random number. Throughout the app, this number can be used to search for subjects.

If necessary, a secondary ID can be assigned by PITT staff at the point of enrollment (the PITT BHI Study ID), allowing participant records in the app to be linked to PITT study records more conveniently. If used, this ID can also be searched to identify participants.
