# FPHS secure web app supporting the University of Pittsburgh Brain Health Initiative

## Background

The FPHS Athena - University of Pittsburgh Brain Health Initiative App (referred to at the PITT BHI App) provides a secure web application for coordinating and recording interactions between study participants, FPHS staff and University of Pittsburgh Brain Health Initiative staff.

The app streamlines common activities, phone screening, and capture of essential information. It also enforces requirements of the protocol around which users can see what data at certain times, to assist in compliance and subsequent audit.

Importantly, the app allows for PHI data and files to be captured without relying on external secure transfer or storage apps.
