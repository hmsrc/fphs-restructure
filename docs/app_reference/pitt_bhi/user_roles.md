# User Roles

Each user is assigned a set of user roles that define:

* Participants they can view
* Search tabs they can access
* Reports they can run
* Process panels they can view
* Activities they can log
* Data they can read, edit or create
* Notifications they receive

A single role typically combines the most appropriate combination of these access controls.
