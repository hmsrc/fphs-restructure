The app streamlines the valid entry of request information by an analyst, and the selection of requested variables from multiple datasets. The FPHS Data Manager has the opportunity to review and classify the request before passing it through the review process, based on its classifications.

Principal Investigators for the Data Repository and studies are notified by email of a new review, and have the opportunity to coordinate with stakeholders and faculty before approving or rejecting the request.

On approval, the Data Manager fulfils the delivery of data through the creation of appropriate database schema objects and export of CSV files delivered securely through the app.

Additionally, authorized users can review datasets and the available variables they contain, to plan future analyses.
